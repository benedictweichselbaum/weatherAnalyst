# Weather Analyst
## Goal of the application
The goal of this application is to collect and analyse weather data from my local town. <br/>
The collected data is represented by a HTML/CSS/JS-Document which inhabits the data. Furthermore
all data gets stored in a Postgresql database in order to make long term analysis.

## TO-DOs
- [ ] Capture Data (RSS?)
- [ ] Define DB Scheme
- [ ] Make DB connection
- [ ] Analyse Data (Create Data objects)
- [ ] Generate HTML output
- [ ] Implement long term analysis

## Availability
The final information output via HTML/CSS/JS is realized by an Apache web server. It is reachable
under http://192.168.178.37/ <br/>
Right now you have to be in my local network to access it.
